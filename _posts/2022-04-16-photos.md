Something a little different this week - more of a photo journal than a blog post. Before we left Vancouver, I purchased a new camera so I could take somewhat nicer photos than I'd be able to with my phone. (Kudos to my friend Jordy for helping me choose the Canon EOS M50 Mark II!) I really had no idea how to use it, though, so when I found the [Edinburgh Photography Workshop](https://edinburghphotographyworkshop.com/) "Switch to Manual" course I thought it'd be a great way to both see the city and learn how to actually use my camera. I went on the course today and had a blast with Rich learning all about aperture, shutter speed, ISO and more. Below you'll find some of the photos I took during the course (with an extra-special photo at the end). Above you can see Victoria Street, near where we're staying.

Yes, that's right - we found a van! On Monday morning we headed to a caravan and motorhome dealer to the west of Edinburgh to take a look at a few camper vans and get a feel for the layouts and features available. We were not expecting to find a van that day, but I fell in love with one of the first ones we walked into. It was so bright and had a really nice seating area that looked open and inviting, and I could picture us both sitting at the large table working at our laptops, or reading books after dinner. We'd made a list of our "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves", and this camper ticked all the boxes! (Except for left-hand drive, a "nice-to-have" which was an extremely long shot in the UK!) Since the motorhome market is very hot right now, we decided to make a move then and there and put our deposit down. Luckily they are able to keep the van there for us until May 6, which means we don't have to worry about finding a place to store it while we stay in the city. I'm so excited to move on to the next phase of our adventure now that we have our home on wheels, but we still have five weeks to enjoy Edinburgh before then.
