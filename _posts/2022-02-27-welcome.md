This post is basically just a placeholder so I can start sharing my blog link with friends and family. We are currently T minus three weeks and two days until liftoff to Manchester. We are now one apartment down (one to go) in terms of packing and sorting our stuff. That being said... are you in the market for an assortment of IKEA lamps? Pantry goods? Partially-used cleaning products? Let us know! Everything must go!
