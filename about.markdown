I'm a Canadian software developer from the west coast of BC. I enjoy exploring the outdoors by running, hiking or biking, and like to relax with some knitting or a good book - and a cup of tea, of course!

My partner Jacob and I are embarking on a travel adventure, first to the UK and then across Europe in our to-be-purchased camper van. Once we're tired of driving, we'll settle down in the city of our choice! For more details, see my post on [The Plan]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-03-14-plan %}).
